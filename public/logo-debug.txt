If you're seeing this file, it means your logo.png might not be loading correctly.

Common issues:
1. The logo file might not be named exactly "logo.png" (case-sensitive)
2. The file might be in the wrong location (should be in apps/storefront/public/)
3. The file might have permission issues

To debug:
1. Check if your logo.png exists in the public folder
2. Try renaming it to ensure it's exactly "logo.png" (lowercase)
3. Try a different image format like JPG (and update the code to use logo.jpg)
4. Check browser console for any 404 errors related to logo.png

If you're still having issues, you can use the text fallback which should display "MAISON MKY" in your brand color.
